# **ON THE BRINK: COLLAPSE AS CODE**



In September 2019, Ursula von der Leyen, then President-Elect of the European Commission, announced new policy portfolios including one for the "Protection of our European Way of Life"[^1]tasked to "*address and allay legitimate fears and concerns about the impact of irregular migration on our economy and society*."[^2]
"Our way of life" as code for whiteness that is constantly subject to the external threat of irregular migration is nothing new. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection website informs users that "*the U.S. Border Patrol has a long and rich history of helping to secure and protect the American way of life.*"[^3]

Of course, even a brief dive into the history of the U.S. Border Patrol is enough to reveal a legacy of violence, human rights violations, and racist policies.[^4] 

This code language was made evidently clear recently in the way Eastern European countries welcomed and supported thousands of Ukrainian refugees who, as some commentators put it, are "civilized" or "look like us."[^5]

Despite recent scrutiny over human rights violations, [^6] Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, has significantly increased its budget and personnel.[^7] In March 2020, now president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced, from the Greek border, the deployment of a hundred Frontex border guards, six coastal patrol vessels, two helicopters, one aircraft, and three thermo-vision vehicles, and concluded in Greek: “I thank Greece for being our European ασπίδα (shield) in these times." [^8]

Holding the “shield” against migration as a political priority  is enabled by a sense of imminent collapse or constant fear. Collapse is useful even before or whether it actually occurs. State authorities instrumentalize the continuous threat of crisis to legitimize aggressive migration policies that are only partially effective in their deterrence objective, and that maintain the fear of new arrivals in a cyclical fashion. As Britta Anderson writes:

> Practices including ICE raids, family separation, and indefinite detention have become institu-
> tionalized as responses to undocumented immigration, fueling a continual state of fear. (…) crisis is not a provisional suspension of procedures (…) but rather a cyclical, operative state of continuing shock. This temporality of ongoing crisis is a modality crucial to capitalism’s continual operation.[^9]

The crisis narrative in relation to migration[^10] does not only work on the performative level. Dualities of border crisis vs. protection or collapse vs. construction materialize on the ground in ways that feed the cyclical logic of crisis that migration policies are based on.

# **PREVENTABLE RUINS: MATERIAL COLLAPSE**



## THE CAMP

In the summer of 2015 I carried out ethnographic fieldwork in the Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesvos, Greece.

Moria, now known as one of the most notorious refugee camps in Europe that encapsulated the "Fortress Europe" policies, was built as a refugee "hotspot" in a former military camp on an olive grove slope near the village of the same name. "Hotspots" were conceptualized and implemented by the European Commission as "Reception and Identification Centers" (RIC) for migrants and asylum seekers. Operated by local authorities in collaboration with Frontex and Europol, their objective is to "swiftly identify, register, and fingerprint incoming migrants."[^11]

At the time of my visit, a high-ranking police officer estimated the site's capacity at 1,200 people. Over 600 migrants and refugees were at the core of camp ("Moria in") waiting to be processed while over 2,000 were camped, mostly in tents, at the periphery of the camp ("Moria out"). The authorities used a strategy of internal spatial division and segregation of asylum seekers as a way of filtering and prioritizing their processing based on country of origin and vulnerability. [^12]  Asylum seekers at the core processing unit of the camp were subject to limited mobility through internal gates. Those at the periphery were able to walk to the city to get supplies and return to the camp to spend the night. Water and food portions were rationed, hygiene conditions were extremely poor, and conditions were not safe especially for women and children at the camp's periphery. It was clear that the camp was stretched to its limits.

Pollozek and Passoth note: "the hotspot can be understood as a merging point of both sides of the European migration regime, being part of the hardened exterior frontier of the EU and of transnational control assemblages." [^13] Despite its failing conditions, Moria was a functional processing site for biometrics and asylum-seeking claims. Political geographer Pallister-Wilkins reminds us that "Fortress Europe" is not a monolithic project blocking border-crossers, but one of “channeling mobilities” in specific, desired ways. [^14] n all its transformations, Moria never ceased to operate, even while authorities were struggling to maintain a sense of order in the camp, in parallel to other migration control sites and networks that served European migration policies. 

## THE CAMP ON FIRE



When I revisited the camp in 2018, the tents around the main site had expanded east, west, and north. NGO workers, volunteers and locals I talked to shared their concern about the unsustainable conditions in the camp. Migrants and refugees would often protest their living conditions and would ask to be transferred to other, safer camps and shelters. Violent incidents among groups would occasionally erupt. The great majority of migrants and refugees lived in tents and self-managed, makeshift shelters dispersed beyond the main camp's fence. On September 19, 2018, journalist Louise Milner reported: "Around 9,000 people are stuck in tents and shipping containers at the former military base. The capacity is for around 3,000 people, so it's reaching a boiling point."[^15] It was clear that Moria was slowly collapsing. Its infrastructural collapse was manifested, from a bird's eye view, as a spatial collapse, an exploded, dispersed micro-geography of small structures, trash, and debris. It was already morphing into what archaeologist Yiannis Hamilakis has called Europe's "ruins in the making."[^16]
