# ON THE BRINK: COLLAPSE AS CODE



In September 2019, Ursula von der Leyen, then President-Elect of the European Commission, announced new policy portfolios including one for the "Protection of our European Way of Life"[^1]tasked to "*address and allay legitimate fears and concerns about the impact of irregular migration on our economy and society*."[^2] "Our way of life" as code for whiteness that is constantly subject to the external threat of irregular migration is nothing new. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection website informs users that "*the U.S. Border Patrol has a long and rich history of helping to secure and protect the American way of life.*"[^3]

 id="nf2rTb49H1c">



Of course, even a brief dive into the history of the U.S. Border Patrol is enough to reveal a legacy of violence, human rights violations, and racist policies.[^4] 

This code language was made evidently clear recently in the way Eastern European countries welcomed and supported thousands of Ukrainian refugees who, as some commentators put it, are "civilized" or "look like us."[^5] 

<param ve-video id="2z9UyPurVok">



Despite recent scrutiny over human rights violations, [^6] Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, has significantly increased its budget and personnel.[^7] In March 2020, now president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced, from the Greek border, the deployment of a hundred Frontex border guards, six coastal patrol vessels, two helicopters, one aircraft, and three thermo-vision vehicles, and concluded in Greek: “I thank Greece for being our European ασπίδα (shield) in these times." [^8]

id="G4qh6X16eys?start=76">


Holding the “shield” against migration as a political priority  is enabled by a sense of imminent collapse or constant fear. Collapse is useful even before or whether it actually occurs. State authorities instrumentalize the continuous threat of crisis to legitimize aggressive migration policies that are only partially effective in their deterrence objective, and that maintain the fear of new arrivals in a cyclical fashion. As Britta Anderson writes:

> Practices including ICE raids, family separation, and indefinite detention have become institu-
> tionalized as responses to undocumented immigration, fueling a continual state of fear. (…) crisis is not a provisional suspension of procedures (…) but rather a cyclical, operative state of continuing shock. This temporality of ongoing crisis is a modality crucial to capitalism’s continual operation.[^9] 
>

The crisis narrative in relation to migration[^10] does not only work on the performative level. Dualities of border crisis vs. protection or collapse vs. construction materialize on the ground in ways that feed the cyclical logic of crisis that migration policies are based on.

# **PREVENTABLE RUINS: MATERIAL COLLAPSE**



## THE CAMP

In the summer of 2015 I carried out ethnographic fieldwork in the Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesvos, Greece. 

<param ve-image 
label="Moria, 2015"
url=/img/Moria_2015.jpg>

Moria, now known as one of the most notorious refugee camps in Europe that encapsulated the "Fortress Europe" policies, was built as a refugee "hotspot" in a former military camp on an olive grove slope near the village of the same name. "Hotspots" were conceptualized and implemented by the European Commission as "Reception and Identification Centers" (RIC) for migrants and asylum seekers. Operated by local authorities in collaboration with Frontex and Europol, their objective is to "swiftly identify, register, and fingerprint incoming migrants."[^11]

At the time of my visit, a high-ranking police officer estimated the site's capacity at 1,200 people. Over 600 migrants and refugees were at the core of camp ("Moria in") waiting to be processed while over 2,000 were camped, mostly in tents, at the periphery of the camp ("Moria out"). The authorities used a strategy of internal spatial division and segregation of asylum seekers as a way of filtering and prioritizing their processing based on country of origin and vulnerability. [^12]  Asylum seekers at the core processing unit of the camp were subject to limited mobility through internal gates. Those at the periphery were able to walk to the city to get supplies and return to the camp to spend the night. Water and food portions were rationed, hygiene conditions were extremely poor, and conditions were not safe especially for women and children at the camp's periphery. It was clear that the camp was stretched to its limits. 


<param ve-map 
center="Q30752848"
zoom="18">

Pollozek and Passoth note: "the hotspot can be understood as a merging point of both sides of the European migration regime, being part of the hardened exterior frontier of the EU and of transnational control assemblages." [^13] Despite its failing conditions, Moria was a functional processing site for biometrics and asylum-seeking claims. Political geographer Pallister-Wilkins reminds us that "Fortress Europe" is not a monolithic project blocking border-crossers, but one of “channeling mobilities” in specific, desired ways. [^14] n all its transformations, Moria never ceased to operate, even while authorities were struggling to maintain a sense of order in the camp, in parallel to other migration control sites and networks that served European migration policies. 

## THE CAMP ON FIRE



When I revisited the camp in 2018, the tents around the main site had expanded east, west, and north. NGO workers, volunteers and locals I talked to shared their concern about the unsustainable conditions in the camp. Migrants and refugees would often protest their living conditions and would ask to be transferred to other, safer camps and shelters. Violent incidents among groups would occasionally erupt. The great majority of migrants and refugees lived in tents and self-managed, makeshift shelters dispersed beyond the main camp's fence. On September 19, 2018, journalist Louise Milner reported: "Around 9,000 people are stuck in tents and shipping containers at the former military base. The capacity is for around 3,000 people, so it's reaching a boiling point."[^15] It was clear that Moria was slowly collapsing. Its infrastructural collapse was manifested, from a bird's eye view, as a spatial collapse, an exploded, dispersed micro-geography of small structures, trash, and debris. It was already morphing into what archaeologist Yiannis Hamilakis has called Europe's "ruins in the making."[^16]

<param ve-image 
label="Moria, 2018"
url=/img/Moria_2018.jpeg>



Despite efforts by local doctors and international humanitarian organizations like the MSF, families with children, unaccompanied minors, seniors in poor health, young women, migrants and refugees with disabilities and mental health issues were exposed to a continuous, anxiety-inducing risk of harm and suffering, including injury and sexual violence. Humanitarian workers in the camp shared in my interviews with them that they had been working well beyond their limits, struggling to protect their own mental health and wellbeing. A psychologist working with unaccompanied minors told me: "I don't feel I am a psychologist. I feel like I am a firefighter."[^17]

Not long after my visit, literal fires emerged in the camp. In September 2019, a mother and child died in a container when two fires broke out in the main camp and the tents just outside of it. Deadly incidents like this one were not uncommon in Moria. In January 2017, a Syrian and an Egyptian man died of carbon monoxide inhalation after trying to warm up their tents by lighting a fire.[^18]

On September 8, 2020, multiple fires erupted in the camp, setting tents and containers ablaze. Only a few tents survived. The rest of the camp was destroyed, causing the displacement, overnight, of nearly 13,000 people. Greek authorities blamed six asylum seekers protesting Covid 19 quarantine measures for the fires. In June 2021, four Afghans were sentenced to ten years in prison for arson with risk to human life, despite objections over the evidence and requests by the lawyers to be tried by a juvenile court. [^19]



## **The Camp 2.0**

Moria’s collapse, seen as a "disaster waiting to happen" [^20]  or as "the moral failure of Europe"[^21] was both predictable and preventable. On the day before the destructive fire, Moria was the largest displacement camp in Europe serving – at the cost of lives and suffering of asylum seekers – the objectives of European migration policies. One of the pillars of these policies was the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement according to which all “new irregular migrants” would be returned to Turkey while Syrian refugees would find a legal pathway to EU member states. [^22] Critical parts of the deal such as the transfer of Syrian refugees to EU member states were barely implemented and resulted in an unending limbo for asylum seekers.

In October 2020, the Greek authorities broke ground for a new "closed-type” refugee camp, not too far from Moria, with funding from the European Commission. [^23] The new camp, located in a former Greek Army shooting range, was planned to host 2,500 migrants and refugees. As soon as the first winter came, it was clear that the new site, built on gravel by the sea, with no trees or vegetation, was exposed to floods and winds. However, the closed, more contained type of camp with increased security screening that kept migrants and refugees out of sight, was welcomed by state authorities as well as some locals, especially following the chaotic destruction of Moria and the protests that followed. The new camp is already called by camp occupants, officers, and locals, not without a sense of sarcasm, "Moria 2."

# **COLLAPSE CAMOUFLAGE: THE TACTICAL (IN)VISIBILITY OF BORDER VIOLENCE**

------

## HYPER-VISIBILITY AND DISTRACTION

Discussing a 2018 court order to reunite migrant families separated during Trump’s brutal “Zero Tolerance Policy,” Shannon Mattern notes: "*The border apparatus could not be marshaled to comply with the court order, because it was not designed to recognize the humanity of its subjects. It was designed to recognize targets.*"[^24]The border surveillance apparatus, Mattern reminds us, operating at different scales and through different technologies, fails to "see" the subjectivities of people on the move or entire groups and communities altogether. 

Moria’s destruction was seen and witnessed in all its spectacular failure across Europe and the rest of the world. But it was not recognized for all the harm, trauma, death, and injury that it caused to asylum seekers for years. And it was definitely not recognized by the Greek state and European authorities as the immediate result of the hotspot approach that made a site like Moria even thinkable.

The attitude of state authorities towards hotspots intentionally swings between concealment and hyper-visibility. Pushed to their capacity limits, hotspots are kept in operation even as they cause suffering to their occupants. In moments of crisis when the sites become inescapably visible, official narratives propagate the images of destruction to fuel anti-migrant sentiments and, eventually, justify more rigid security and detainment measures. Moria's spectacular collapse was seen as an exceptional, dramatic moment, a monumental failure. This, however, was a distraction that was used to justify an escalation of mobility restriction and border securitization on multiple levels.

Although not all refugee camps are built with the same provisions in place for relatively safe living conditions, crises in such sites are not unexpected. The moment of collapse  in the case of Moria was the culmination of the ways in which it operated for years. The shocking effect of its fiery destruction and of the displacement of its inhabitants was effective as a media event, in terms of triggering anti-migrant political discourse and reactions by local communities. Whether in the context of the European hotspot approach or the "prevention through deterrence" doctrine in the U.S., the spectacle of violence and suffering in refugee camps, often fetishized to anaesthetization extremes, is perceived, itself, as a threat, rather as the immediate result of specific, calculated policies.

This hyper-visibility of violence and destruction serves as a distraction from the broader and often elusive architecture of mobility control that is in place in multiple other physical and virtual locations. The physical U.S.-Mexico border wall is just one component of a network of border patrol agents, detention centers, facial recognition cameras, and databases that expand well into the U.S. mainland.[^25]Similarly, the European refugee hotspot is merely a logistical processing site within a networked infrastructure of border walls and fences, Frontex ships, Greek Coast Guard ships, and drones. Frontex, for example, announced 468 aerial surveillance flights in 2021 and 1,030 in 2020 alone.[^26] All of these surveillance nodes and operations feed data into European information systems such as the Schengen Information System or the European Dactyloscopy database (Eurodac).

Recent scholarly, activist, and independent journalism projects [^27] have focused on "soft" structures, non-human actors, networks and assemblages of the border violence and surveillance regime that are less traceable, and concealed, sometimes, under what Eyal Weizman has called the "threshold of detectability."[^28] Even as state actors performatively, or even celebratorily, announce new walls, fences, and "hotspots", the scrutiny over other types of operations or infrastructures like pushbacks in the Mediterranean or undisclosed surveillance systems, is unwanted as it may reveal human rights violations and raise claims for justice and accountability.  

## INFRASTRUCTURAL DUALITIES



In their study of refugee tents in Denmark, scholars Whyte, Campbell and Overgaard use a pair of terms to describe the seemingly paradoxical ways in which refugee camps operate: "spectacular obscurity" and "successful failure".[^29] "Spectacular obscurity" refers to the ways in which refugee camps are "presented as spectacle but their everyday functioning was explicitly obscured."[^30] "Successful failure" is used to describe how although "camp infrastructure was routinely failing, this formed the basis for its actual daily functioning." [^31] 

Both of these concepts are useful in trying to understand the multiple levels on which refugee camps, asylum shelters or hotspots operate. In the case of Moria, while the site was often at the forefront of media attention, what was obscured, at the same time, were the bureaucratic, mundane tasks at the heart of its critical mission: identifying, screening, sorting, and processing bodies, languages, ethnicities, and vulnerabilities. These were the bureaucratic tasks causing massive bottlenecks that kept thousands of people in suspended uncertainty. 

The second concept, that of "successful failure," captures the slow, accumulative effect of daily small failures in a refugee camp: "minor, infrastructural failures, such as showers with only burning hot or cold water, poor temperature regulation in tents, dirty toilets (...) these failures did not so much call for repair and maintenance, as they did for evasion and circumvention."[^32] These daily failures and struggles, despite differences in living conditions, are familiar to thousands of asylum seekers, from the Danish refugee tent camps to the Calais "jungle.” On a performative level, such failures communicate both to camp occupants and to external observers that conditions are meant to be harsh as a deterrence signal.  On a strategic level, these never repaired failures, which often raise tensions or trigger protests in the camps, are used by authorities to impose more restrictive measures. 

What keeps asylum seekers in limbo is not just the lack of care, repair, or resources, but also the targeted ways in which humanitarian care is administered. Care, provided in hotspots based on "vulnerabilities" and other taxonomies, reinforces "hierarchies of mobility."[^33] Channeling Jasbir Puar's concept of "deliberate debilitation" as biopolitical strategy, Polly Pallister Wilkins notes: 

>
> *hotspots work with particular — yet partial — forms of humanitarian relief to produce racialised regimes of differential mobility and marginalised, unequal, and debilitated life. That is, human life not considered equal but at the same time not allowed to die, alongside life subjected to regimes of legibility and registration that (re)produce racialised populations within a framework of recognition reaffirming European white supremacy.* [^34] 
>

In discussing the "infrastructural warfare" launched by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza, Puar expands the notion of debilitated bodies into debilitated infrastructures and landscapes. [^35]   Refugee camps in the Mediterranean present, of course, significant geographical, political, and operational differences. The concept of deliberate debilitation, however, as means of reaching a desired result, touches at the core of how some of these sites operate. Deliberately exposing migrants and refugees to risk of suffering, death and injury, or keeping them suspended in conditions of extreme precarity, is a way of exercising control over bodies, their ability to move and their sense of agency and dignity.

The lack, or denial of care can take extreme forms within migration control infrastructures. As I am writing these lines, independent news media are still reporting details of an incident on the mainland border between Greece and Turkey. In early August 2022, a group of refugees were stranded on an islet on the river of Evros on the Greek-Turkish border. Following calls from international organizations, Greece refused help or to rescue the group, claiming that the islet was not part of Greek territory, even after reports that a five-year-old girl died due to complications from a scorpion bite. When eventually the stranded group managed to cross into the Greek mainland, the Greek government acknowledged the incident and the death of the five-year old girl but didn't miss the opportunity to blame the Turkish side for enabling and weaponizing border-crossers as a factor of destabilization. Although the incident is still being investigated, what is striking is the willingness to waive territorial control or jurisdiction as a means of denying responsibility and humanitarian aid. In this highly surveilled border region, recently equipped with miles of new border fence and surveillance technologies, the Greek authorities refused to see and recognize the group of refugees.[^36]  This calculated inaction and jurisdictional and infrastructural withdrawal left the border-crossers stranded and exposed to deadly, unnecessary risk. [^37] 

# **WHEN THE FORTRESS FOLDS: NOTE ON RESILIENCE AND COUNTER-TACTICS**

------

Whether by design or not, mobility control infrastructures are as much about porousness as about solidity. From Lesvos to Ceuta and Arizona, migrants and refugees come up with new ways to navigate increasingly militarized landscapes and seascapes or seek help and rescue. They follow policy shifts and infrastructural changes with a responsive resilience, always looking for safer routes and conditions. In 2018, as Moria was increasingly becoming unsafe, a local teacher took the initiative of setting up a makeshift school with plywood and tin roofs in a safe location a few miles from the camp. The school, named “Stand by Me,” provided safety and a sense of normalcy for women and children in response to the infrastructural collapse of the camp.

To acknowledge the malleability of border infrastructures is not to dismiss the lethal and debilitating violence they produce. Rethinking these infrastructures as adaptive, deteriorating, or shifting helps paint a more accurate picture of the intrinsic ways in which they operate. It also helps shift from a view of "people on the move" having to overcome fixed, unchanged infrastructures to a more nuanced understanding of border surveillance assemblages that, themselves, move and follow border-crossers. These infrastructures grow and expand, or, when needed, recede and retract. As a matter of fact, the ability to deploy, disassemble and reassemble, to be both visible and invisible, is what makes these infrastructures effective. 

At the same time, to say that border control infrastructures are retractable or collapsible helps illuminate the artificial, selective, and reversible nature of their very existence. To think of collapse not as a permanent state but as a counter-tactical conceptual device can help shift focus towards more strategic refugee support and solidarity approaches centered around questions of power, agency, and legitimacy. In this sense, we can think of collapse not as an irreversible condition but as a conditional reversal of racist and xenophobic policies enabled through alliance networks and collective action.
