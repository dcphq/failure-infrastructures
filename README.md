# **ON THE BRINK: COLLAPSE AS CODE**

In September 2019, Ursula von der Leyen, then President-Elect of the European Commission, announced new policy portfolios including one for the "Protection of our European Way of Life"[^1]tasked to "*address and allay legitimate fears and concerns about the impact of irregular migration on our economy and society*."[^2]
"Our way of life" as code for whiteness that is constantly subject to the external threat of irregular migration is nothing new. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection website informs users that "*the U.S. Border Patrol has a long and rich history of helping to secure and protect the American way of life.*"[^3]

Of course, even a brief dive into the history of the U.S. Border Patrol is enough to reveal a legacy of violence, human rights violations, and racist policies.[^4] 

This code language was made evidently clear recently in the way Eastern European countries welcomed and supported thousands of Ukrainian refugees who, as some commentators put it, are "civilized" or "look like us."[^5]

Despite recent scrutiny over human rights violations, [^6] Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, has significantly increased its budget and personnel.[^7] In March 2020, now president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced, from the Greek border, the deployment of a hundred Frontex border guards, six coastal patrol vessels, two helicopters, one aircraft, and three thermo-vision vehicles, and concluded in Greek: “I thank Greece for being our European ασπίδα (shield) in these times." [^8]

Holding the “shield” against migration as a political priority  is enabled by a sense of imminent collapse or constant fear. Collapse is useful even before or whether it actually occurs. State authorities instrumentalize the continuous threat of crisis to legitimize aggressive migration policies that are only partially effective in their deterrence objective, and that maintain the fear of new arrivals in a cyclical fashion. As Britta Anderson writes:

> Practices including ICE raids, family separation, and indefinite detention have become institu-
> tionalized as responses to undocumented immigration, fueling a continual state of fear. (…) crisis is not a provisional suspension of procedures (…) but rather a cyclical, operative state of continuing shock. This temporality of ongoing crisis is a modality crucial to capitalism’s continual operation.[^9]

The crisis narrative in relation to migration[^10] does not only work on the performative level. Dualities of border crisis vs. protection or collapse vs. construction materialize on the ground in ways that feed the cyclical logic of crisis that migration policies are based on.

## THE CAMP

In the summer of 2015 I carried out ethnographic fieldwork in the Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesvos, Greece.
